It is the year 4003 you are in an Electronical war between two armies. You are a troop that has been trained in the arts of electronic guns for 10 years. You have been awarded with numerous medals and honors. This has been one of the biggest wars known to the electronical race. Unfortunately even with the skill and the strategies that you have, you were captured by the opposing army and are now being held in a cell. Like any other average prisoner you think to yourself, &quot;why would I stay here?&quot;

The Year 4003
An Interactive Fiction by Logan Moss
Release 1 / Serial number 130307 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Cell A
A prison cell that is concealed. The walls and the floor are made of some type of concrete. On the left side of the room is my makeshift of a bed. I need to stop looking around and figure out if I can find a way to get out of this cage. There is a door to the north of the room, the door says Cell A.

Cell B
A cell room that looks like it hasn&apos;t been used in over 400 years. In the corner there is a broken down bed frame. In the back of the room you spot something that has been collecting dust, it looks like a plaque. You can also see something that looks very high-tech, you can tell it wasn&apos;t installed recently, but it looks high-tech. Kind of some sort of voice application.

You can see Voice Activation here.

The wall begins to push outwards, you first think you&apos;re going to get crushed. However, it seems to shift into different shapes leaving behind an opening that looks like a secret passage to the north.

You are in the lobby of the building. It seems to be bustling with many guards and employee&apos;s. You see a lot of people wearing nurse and doctor outfits, probably because of the war going on outside. There are many potted plants and couches. As you look around, you notice many people that look crazy, odd. You&apos;ve made it! To the north there is the exit to the building, you&apos;ll soon be out of here and into freedom.

Cell A
A prison cell that is concealed. The walls and the floor are made of some type of concrete. On the left side of the room is my makeshift of a bed. I need to stop looking around and figure out if I can find a way to get out of this cage. There is a door to the north of the room, the door says Cell A. Why does this seem so vaguely familar?

Just then a female pushing a cart walks in.
&quot;Good afternoon Mr. Williams, are you ready for your daily medicine?&quot;
&quot;Who are you? Who am I?&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re silly! I&apos;m your caretaker! You obviously know who you are! Just look at your nametag on your shirt!&quot;

The wall begins to push outwards, you first think you&apos;re going to get crushed. However, it seems to shift into different shapes leaving behind an opening that looks like a secret passage.

A cell room that looks like it hasn&apos;t been used in over 400 years. In the corner there is a broken down bed frame. In the back of the room you spot something that has been collecting dust, it looks like a plaque. You can also see something that looks very high-tech, you can tell it wasn&apos;t installed recently, but it looks high-tech. Kind of some sort of voice application.

You can see Voice Activation here.
