It is the year 4003 you are in an Electronical war between two armies. You are a troop that has been trained in the arts of electronic guns for 10 years. You have been awarded with numerous medals and honors. This has been one of the biggest wars known to the electronical race. Unfortunately even with the skill and the strategies that you have, you were captured by the opposing army and are now being held in a cell. Like any other average prisoner you think to yourself, &quot;why would I stay here?&quot;

The Year 4003
An Interactive Fiction by Logan Moss
Release 1 / Serial number 130312 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Cell A
A prison cell that is concealed. The walls and the floor are made of some type of concrete. On the left side of the room is my makeshift of a bed. I need to stop looking around and figure out if I can find a way to get out of this cage. There is a door to the north of the room, the door says Cell A.

Cell B
A cell room that looks like it hasn&apos;t been used in over 400 years. In the corner there is a broken down bed frame. In the back of the room you spot something that has been collecting dust, it looks like a plaque. You can also see something that looks very high-tech, you can tell it wasn&apos;t installed recently, but it looks high-tech. Kind of some sort of voice application.

You can see Voice Activation here.

Lobby
You are in the lobby of the building. It seems to be bustling with many guards and employee&apos;s. You see a lot of people wearing nurse and doctor outfits, probably because of the war going on outside. There are many potted plants and couches. As you look around, you notice many people that look crazy, odd. You&apos;ve made it! To the north there is the exit to the building, you&apos;ll soon be out of here and into freedom.

Cell A
A prison cell that is concealed. The walls and the floor are made of some type of concrete. On the left side of the room is my makeshift of a bed. I need to stop looking around and figure out if I can find a way to get out of this cage. There is a door to the north of the room, the door says Cell A. Why does this seem so vaguely familar?

Just then a female pushing a cart walks in.
&quot;Good afternoon Mr. Williams, are you ready for your daily medicine?&quot;

You can see Guard Jeffery here.

The guard that has Jeffery on his shirt stands up and says &quot;Hey! What are you doing out of your cell! You can tell Jeffery is a little on the slower side, so I don&apos;t think he will be a problem if you move first.

You have dodged the Guards attack.

You are in the lobby of the building. It seems to be bustling with many guards and employee&apos;s. You see a lot of people wearing nurse and doctor outfits, probably because of the war going on outside. There are many potted plants and couches. As you look around, you notice many people that look crazy, odd. You&apos;ve made it! To the north there is the exit to the building, you&apos;ll soon be out of here and into freedom.

Cell A
A prison cell that is concealed. The walls and the floor are made of some type of concrete. On the left side of the room is my makeshift of a bed. I need to stop looking around and figure out if I can find a way to get out of this cage. There is a door to the north of the room, the door says Cell A. Why does this seem so vaguely familar?

Just then a female pushing a cart walks in.
&quot;Good afternoon Mr. Williams, are you ready for your daily medicine?&quot;
&quot;Who are you? Who am I?&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re silly! I&apos;m your caretaker! You obviously know who you are! Just look at your nametag on your shirt!&quot;

A hallway that has a couple bits and pieces of wrappers and trash around. You would think in the year 4003 they would take more care of the place. There are foor door ways that lead into seperate rooms. In the west, there&apos;s a door that is labeled Storage. In the east, there&apos;s a door that has the label Cell B. In the north you can hear chatter and harsh voices and tones, probably the guard room.

Cell B
A cell room that looks like it hasn&apos;t been used in over 400 years. In the corner there is a broken down bed frame. In the back of the room you spot something that has been collecting dust, it looks like a plaque. You can also see something that looks very high-tech, you can tell it wasn&apos;t installed recently, but it looks high-tech. Kind of some sort of voice application.
