It is the year 4003 you are in an Electronical war between two armies. You are a troop that has been trained in the arts of electronic guns for 10 years. You have been awarded with numerous medals and honors. This has been one of the biggest wars known to the electronical race. Unfortunately even with the skill and the strategies that you have, you were captured by the opposing army and are now being held in a cell. Like any other average prisoner you think to yourself, &quot;why would I stay here?&quot;

The Year 4003
An Interactive Fiction by Logan Moss
Release 1 / Serial number 130228 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Cell A
A prison cell that is concealed. The walls and the floor are made of some type of concrete. On the left side of the room is my makeshift of a bed. I need to stop looking around and figure out if I can find a way to get out of this cage. There is a door to the north of the room, the door says Cell A.
