It is the year 4003 you are in an Electronical war between two armies. You are a troop that has been trained in the arts of electronic guns for 10 years. You have been awarded with numerous medals and honors. This has been one of the biggest wars known to the electronical race. Unfortunately even with the skill and the strategies that you have, you were captured by the opposing army and are now being held in a cell. Like any other average prisoner you think to yourself, &quot;why would I stay here?&quot;

The Year 4003
An Interactive Fiction by Logan Moss
Release 1 / Serial number 130306 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Cell A
A prison cell that is concealed. The walls and the floor are made of some type of concrete. On the left side of the room is my makeshift of a bed. I need to stop looking around and figure out if I can find a way to get out of this cage. There is a door to the north of the room, the door says Cell A.

A cell room that looks like it hasn&apos;t been used in over 400 years. In the corner there is a broken down bed frame. In the back of the room you spot something that has been collecting dust, it looks like a plaque. You can also see something that looks very high-tech, you can tell it wasn&apos;t installed recently, but it looks high-tech. Kind of some sort of voice application.

Very dusty and dark. Someone really needs to clean the cobwebs and dust off the floor and the corners. You look to the left to see a shelf.

You pat your hand on top of the shelf and notice a bump that seems to have made a high pitched tinging sound. It sounds like a key.
